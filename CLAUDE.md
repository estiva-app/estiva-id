# Estiva ID, for Claude Code

## Tests: house rules

Read these before writing or changing a test (agent or person). `/land`'s code
reviewer checks every new test in a PR against them (PEE-50, UNI-4).

- **Test what a person or the relay sees**: the rendered text, the enabled
  control, the event that goes on the wire, the row a reader gets back. Not how
  the code arrives there.
- **No tests of** constants, CSS class names, re-exports, type shapes, or
  debugging instruments (a `console.log` or a probe hook). They pass on a broken
  feature and fail on a harmless rename.
- **Fake timers, never real sleeps.** `vi.useFakeTimers()` and advance the clock;
  no `setTimeout` waits, no `sleep(…)`. Real waits fail under load and hide
  races.
- **Test writes at the wire.** A send, edit, delete or membership change is
  asserted on the signed event that would reach the relay (kind, tags, content,
  signer), not on a mocked helper being called.
- **A new test must fail on the bug it is for.** Run it on the code before your
  change: it must fail on an assertion, not on a missing import or a timeout.
  `/land` runs the same check (`old-code-check.mjs`) and, on a PR touching read
  state, access, membership or the wire, plants bugs in the changed lines
  (`plant-check.mjs`); a planted bug no test catches means a test is missing.
- **Mocking a module the code relies on is a decision.** If a test mocks a module
  (for example Ship mocks `./nip44`), something else must cover that module's own
  contract.
- **A test says what it guards**: its name states the behaviour and the case, so
  a red run reads as a real bug.
